While all geckos are lizards, not all lizards are geckos.
If you have been wondering what the difference is between geckos vs lizards, you’re in the right place.
Geckos are members of the Gekkonidae family, while lizards are members of the Lacertidae family.
But this is only the beginning of their differences. Let’s dive in and learn more now.

The first difference when it comes to geckos vs lizards lies in their overall appearance.
Geckos are usually small, less than a foot in length, while many other species of lizard can be as large as ten feet in length.
Geckos are easily recognizable by their developed feet and adhesive toe pads;
few other lizard species have fully formed toes like gecko toes.

The evolutionary origin of turtles is one of the last unanswered questions in vertebrate evolution.
Paleontological and morphological studies place turtles as either evolving from the ancestor of all reptiles or as evolving from the ancestor of snakes, lizards, and tuataras.
Conflictingly, genetic studies place turtles as evolving from the ancestor of crocodilians and birds.

Both birds and reptiles are descended from the group Reptilia, which are diapsids, or animals with two openings on each side of the skull.
So from a phylogenetic standpoint, birds are reptiles.
