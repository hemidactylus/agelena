Watering Flower Pots

Flowers and vegetables growing in pots have only a limited amount of soil from which to draw moisture, and their roots can’t expand outward to search for more in dry weather.
These are going to be your neediest plantings—especially those in sunny locations—so be sure to check them daily or even twice a day if the weather is hot and dry.
Remember that wind also tends to dry out your plants more quickly, causing them to wilt.

When it comes to containers, it’s better to look for cues on whether the plant needs water versus watering on a set schedule.
- Look at the soil color. Dry soil is lighter in color. Wet soil is darker in color.
- Check the pots to make sure the soil has not pulled away from the edge. If it has, water will just run down that space and right out of the pot instead of sinking in around the roots where it is needed. If necessary, add more soil to fill that gap.
- Put your finger in the soil, down to the first or second knuckle. Water only when this top layer (1-2 inches) of soil is dry.
- If the soil is too dry to hold water, put a tray under the pot to catch run-off water; it will be reabsorbed through the drainage holes. 
- Do not water at night (unless the plant is desperate for water), as this invites disease. Also, be sure to water the soil—NOT the leaves!
- Again, don’t set a schedule. When plants are small in the spring, they may need less water than when they get bigger and the weather gets hotter. Adjust accordingly!

When you water, it’s important to keep watering until the water comes out of the pot’s drainage holes.
- Of course, your pot must have draining holes, or the roots will get overwatered (waterlogged). At least one drainage hole is usually fine.
- That said, do not let your container sit in water. Make sure the water drains out.
