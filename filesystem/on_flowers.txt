Like plants, flowers need a recommended soil to grow, become strong and bloom.
Regardless of whether you are planting your flowers in a pot or a garden, good soil is essential.
Plan what you are looking to grow.

Planting is about where you bed a live flower.
It’s worth remembering that flowers can’t be grown just anywhere.
Too much sun or too little shade will create problems for the health of your flower.
Check the required amount of light before planting.

Do your research and decide on what type to choose.
Use the experience from your local gardening centre.
Check the label that comes with your chosen type or seed packets to make sure the flower is right for you and your garden.
