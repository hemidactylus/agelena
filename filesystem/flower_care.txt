Outdoors, plants are usually defined as sun and shade.
- 'Full sun' refers to a spot that receives about 6 hours or more of direct sunlight per day. 
- 'Partial sun' (or partial shade...these terms are often used interchangeably) is a location that receives about 3 to 6 hours of direct sun per day. 
- 'Shade' means a spot receives less than 3 hours of direct sun per day.

Factors like temperature and time of day can impact a plant's ability to grow in sun.
For example, a shade plant may be able to grow in 2 hours of direct late afternoon sun in Washington state, but that same plant may struggle in 2 hours of direct sun in South Florida.
Likewise, a particular plant may be fine in 6 hours of sun if the soil stays moist.
That same plant may suffer if there are droughty conditions.
