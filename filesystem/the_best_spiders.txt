The Agelenidae are a large family of spiders in the suborder Araneomorphae.
Well-known examples include the common "grass spiders" of the genus Agelenopsis.
Nearly all Agelenidae are harmless to humans, but the bite of the hobo spider (Eratigena agrestis) may be medically significant, and some evidence suggests it might cause necrotic lesions, but the matter remains subject to debate.
The most widely accepted common name for members of the family is funnel weaver.
