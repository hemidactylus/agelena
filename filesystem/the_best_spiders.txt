The Agelenidae are a large family of spiders in the suborder Araneomorphae.
Well-known examples include the common "grass spiders" of the genus Agelenopsis.
Nearly all Agelenidae are harmless to humans, but the bite of the hobo spider (Eratigena agrestis) may be medically significant, and some evidence suggests it might cause necrotic lesions, but the matter remains subject to debate.
The most widely accepted common name for members of the family is funnel weaver.

The body length of the smallest Agelenidae spiders are about 4 mm (0.16 in), excluding the legs, while the larger species grow to 20 mm (0.79 in) long.
Some exceptionally large species, such as Eratigena atrica, may reach 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) in total leg span.

Agelenids have eight eyes in two horizontal rows of four.
Their cephalothoraces narrow somewhat towards the front where the eyes are.
Their abdomens are more or less oval, usually patterned with two rows of lines and spots.
Some species have longitudinal lines on the dorsal surface of the cephalothorax, whereas other species do not;
for example, the hobo spider does not, which assists in informally distinguishing it from similar-looking species.
