Giant spiders from Mars! This is a sci-fi novel, not really about actual spiders.
Any resemblance to organisms occurring in actual biology is accidental.

The giant spiders stormed on the moon base, shattering the thick glass dome with their laser weapons.
Buzz, the hero of this story, tried to push the teleport button ... but it was too late.
